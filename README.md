# Learning-Machine-Learning

*STILL WORKING…*

**Python implementation of Andrew Ng Machine Learning assignments**

After implementing several applications with the help of machine learning, I decided to look back to basics to acquire a better understanding of how machine learning works and why they work so well. It turns out that even I’ve used neural networks many times before, it still costs me a whole day to implement the basic neural network in numpy ☹️, which makes me come to believe such a word:

> To use machine learning is one thing, to understand it is another

It seems endless to dig deep into the principle behind these algorithms, like ML is based on statistics, the statistics is based on probability, and the probability is based on measure theory, then we can finally come to the calculus and algebra. So when solving these assignments I only focus on the algorithm itself with the help of formulas. Hopefully this repo will help you to learn ML more easily 😉.
